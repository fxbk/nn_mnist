# Neuronal Network mnist dataset 

My own NN trained for the mnist dataset. Used a Convolutional NN inspired by LeNet-5 from Yann Lecun (link to the original data: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-98.pdf). Data is from keras. For more information to the dataset visit the offical website of the mnist dataset http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ or the documentation of keras.datasets https://keras.io/datasets/.
